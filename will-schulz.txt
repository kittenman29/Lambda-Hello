My name is Will Schulz.  Three words to describe myself:

charismatic
lazy
pompous

My favorite hobby is fishing.  I just love sitting in a boat for hours on end in the hopes of torturing an animal.
I love to fish with my friends because it's such an exciting sport.  There is always so much going on and it's really
good for the environment to haul a boat around with a fuel-inefficient truck and then drive around pristine waters
in a gas powered boat.
